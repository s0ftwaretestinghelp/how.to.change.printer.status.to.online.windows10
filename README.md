Printers on Windows 11/10 can have a status of offline and online. I was surprised to find that because everyone wants their default printer to be available and ready for print. One should know that when a printer goes offline, it doesn’t mean it has been removed. It could go offline because of an error during printing or an issue with the printer driver. Windows OS can set the status of the printer as offline if it finds a problem. In this post, I will show how you can change a Printer status to online or Restore Printer to online status.

## Printer is Offline? Change a Printer status to online

There is an advantage to turning a printer offline. Nobody can misuse it, and if you have kids at home who keep printing casually, you can block the access. You may have forgotten about turning it offline. So, let’s fix it:

* Restart Printer & Check for connectivity
* Change Printer Status
* Run Printer Troubleshooter
* Remove and Add Printer
* Network Printer troubleshooting.

Make sure to check on the status after trying each of them.

## Get Hints from the Printer’s Status Light

Windows will label your printer “Offline” if there’s a problem with the device. One easy way to tell if there’s an issue with your printer is to check its status lights. For instance, if the Wi-Fi light on a wireless printer flashes red, there’s most likely a problem with the Wi-Fi connection.

Status lights could also indicate other issues like firmware update failure or jammed paper in the cassette. Refer to your printer’s instruction manual or the manufacturer’s website to learn more about its status light indicators.
